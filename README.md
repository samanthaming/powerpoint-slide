# Samantha Ming's Press Kit

## Invite Me To Speak üë©üèª‚Äçüè´

I love sharing my experience and insights. I've spoken at high schools, colleges, and tech companies. From my experience on how I grew my personal brand to 20k+ within a year OR how I switched careers into tech without a CS degree OR how kindness has made me more successful. My goal is to bring value, motivate action, and inspire kindness in your audience.
